# 🚀 Release v0.8.0 - Kuron

We are excited to announce the release of **v0.8.0 (Build 15)**! This update brings significant improvements to discovery, efficiency, and a fresh identity for the app.

## 🌟 What's New?

### 🎯 **Smart Search (Nhentai)**
- **Direct Navigation**: Searching for a numeric ID (e.g., `51234`) now takes you directly to the gallery detail page, skipping the search results screen.
- **Auto-Normalization**: Correctly handles and normalizes numeric IDs (e.g., `00123` → `123`).

### 📑 **Tag Pagination**
- **Browse More**: Added full pagination support for Tag and Genre browsing.
- **Nhentai**: Supports `/tag/{slug}/?page={N}`.
- **Crotpedia**: Supports `/baca/genre/{slug}/page/{N}/`.

### 🔑 **Crotpedia Integration**
- **Chapter Access**: Some chapters now require a login to access. Integrated a source-aware login/account menu in the drawer for Crotpedia.

### 🎨 **Rebranding to "Kuron"**
- **New Identity**: The app has been rebranded to **Kuron** for a more cohesive and premium experience.
- **Updated APK Naming**: Build artifacts now follow the naming pattern `kuron_[version]_[date]_[abi].apk`.
