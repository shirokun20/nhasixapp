# Anti-Detection Configuration Guide

## Current Status: ‚úÖ CONFIGURED

Your anti-detection system is properly configured and should help avoid being detected as a robot.

## Key Features Implemented:

### 1. User Agent Rotation
- 11 different browser user agents
- Automatic rotation every 10 requests
- Covers Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge on Windows/macOS

### 2. Request Headers Randomization
- Random Accept headers
- Random Accept-Language headers  
- Random Accept-Encoding headers
- Sec-CH-UA headers for Chrome compatibility
- DNT, Connection, Upgrade-Insecure-Requests headers

### 3. Request Timing
- Base delay: 1 second between requests
- Increases by 500ms per 10 requests (max 5 seconds)
- Random jitter up to 500ms
- Human behavior simulation (3-10 second reading pauses)
- Break simulation every 20 requests (10-30 seconds)

### 4. Rate Limiting Protection
- Maximum 30 requests per minute
- Automatic throttling when limit approached
- Request counter reset mechanism

### 5. Cloudflare Integration
- Automatic challenge detection
- Bypass attempt with anti-detection headers
- Status verification after bypass

## Usage Tips:

### For Better Results:
1. **Use VPN** if still getting blocked
2. **Change DNS** to 1.1.1.1 or 8.8.8.8
3. **Clear app data** if cookies get flagged
4. **Avoid rapid requests** - let the delays work

### Monitoring:
- Check logs for "Anti-detection" messages
- Monitor request statistics via `getStatistics()`
- Watch for rate limiting warnings

### If Still Detected:
1. Increase base delay in `AntiDetection._calculateMinDelay()`
2. Add more user agents to the rotation pool
3. Implement proxy rotation (advanced)
4. Add more random headers

## Code Locations:
- Anti-detection: `lib/data/datasources/remote/anti_detection.dart`
- Remote data source: `lib/data/datasources/remote/remote_data_source.dart`
- Service locator: `lib/core/di/service_locator.dart`
- Splash bloc: `lib/presentation/blocs/splash/splash_bloc.dart`

## Testing:
Run the app and check logs for:
- "Anti-detection measures initialized"
- "Applying delay: Xms"
- "Simulating reading behavior"
- "Taking a break"

Your configuration should now be much less likely to be detected as a robot! ü§ñ‚û°Ô∏èüë§
