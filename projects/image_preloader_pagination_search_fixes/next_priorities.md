- 🔄 **Currently broken** - Users stuck in navigation loops, can't return to MainScreen properly
- 🛠️ **Half completed** - Tasks 3.1-3.2 already ✅ COMPLETED
- 💪 **Medium effort** - 1-2 days to complete implementation and testing

### **Current Status:**
- [x] **Task 3.1:** Fix _searchByTag navigation ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **Task 3.2:** Fix _navigateToRelatedContent navigation strategy ✅ COMPLETED
- [ ] **Task 3.3:** Implement proper route management **← NEXT**
- [ ] **Task 3.4:** Test multi-level detail navigation
- [ ] **Task 3.5:** Verify tag search returns to MainScreen

### **Remaining Work:**
```markdown
🎯 **Task 3.3: Implement Proper Route Management**
- Review current navigation stack management in detail_screen.dart
- Implement pushAndRemoveUntil for tag search navigation
- Ensure proper filter state preservation during navigation
- Test navigation from: detail → related → detail → tag → MainScreen

🎯 **Task 3.4: Test Multi-Level Detail Navigation**  
- Create test scenarios for nested detail screens
- Verify no memory leaks or stack overflow issues
- Test back button behavior at each navigation level
- Ensure proper disposal of previous screens

🎯 **Task 3.5: Verify Tag Search Returns to MainScreen**
- Test tag click from various detail screen depths
- Verify filter state is properly applied on MainScreen
- Ensure ContentBloc receives correct search events
- Test with different tag types and search combinations
```

### **Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Tag search dari detail screens selalu kembali ke MainScreen
- [ ] No more nested detail navigation issues or stack overflow
- [ ] Filter state properly maintained during navigation transitions
- [ ] Clean navigation stack management tanpa memory leaks
- [ ] Smooth UX for: detail → related → detail → tag → MainScreen flow

### **Estimated Effort:** 1-2 days

## 🔧 **PRIORITY #3: Phase 2 - Download Range Feature**

### **Why This Is #3 Priority:**
- ⚙️ **Enhancement, not critical bug** - Current download system works, just inefficient
- 💾 **Significant storage impact** - Users can save significant storage space
- 🏗️ **Foundation ready** - DownloadRangeSelector widget already created
- 📦 **High complexity** - Requires DownloadBloc changes and metadata structure updates
- 🕒 **Higher effort** - 3-5 days for full implementation

### **Current Status:**
- [x] **Task 2.1:** Create DownloadRangeSelector widget ✅ COMPLETED
- [ ] **Task 2.2:** Update DownloadBloc for partial download support **← NEXT**
- [ ] **Task 2.3:** Modify download system for range-based downloading  
- [ ] **Task 2.4:** Update metadata.json structure for partial content
- [ ] **Task 2.5:** Test range download functionality

### **Remaining Work:**
```markdown
🎯 **Task 2.2: Update DownloadBloc for Partial Download Support**
- Add range parameters to download events and states
- Implement partial download logic in DownloadBloc
- Update download progress tracking for range downloads
- Add error handling for partial download failures

🎯 **Task 2.3: Modify Download System for Range-Based Downloading**
- Update DownloadService to accept startPage and endPage parameters
- Implement selective image downloading logic
- Add resume capability for interrupted range downloads
- Optimize concurrent download handling for ranges

🎯 **Task 2.4: Update metadata.json Structure for Partial Content**
- Extend metadata.json to include downloadedPages array
- Add range information: startPage, endPage, totalPages
- Implement validation for partial content metadata
- Update content detection logic to handle partial downloads

🎯 **Task 2.5: Test Range Download Functionality**
- Test UI: range selector with various page ranges
- Test edge cases: single page, invalid ranges, boundaries
- Test performance: large ranges, concurrent downloads  
- Test reader compatibility with partial content
- Verify metadata accuracy and content validation
```

### **Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Users dapat select download range (page X to Y) via intuitive UI
- [ ] Partial downloads working dengan proper progress tracking
- [ ] metadata.json accurately reflects downloaded page ranges
- [ ] Reader seamlessly supports partial content (shows available pages)
