## 🚨 URGENT PRIORITY - RECENTLY COMPLETED

### ✅ ReaderCubit Race Condition Bug Fix (CRITICAL) - FIXED
**Status**: COMPLETED ✅
**Problem**: App crashes with "Cannot emit new states after calling close" when navigating away from ReaderScreen during async operations
**Root Cause**: Race conditions between async operations (prefetching, timers) and cubit disposal causing emit calls after cubit close
**Solution Applied**:
- Added isClosed checks before all emit operations in ReaderCubit
- Protected all timer callbacks with state validation
- Eliminated race conditions between async operations and cubit disposal
- Enhanced app stability during navigation and screen transitions
**Files Updated**: `/lib/presentation/cubits/reader/reader_cubit.dart`
**Impact**: Critical app stability improvement - no more runtime crashes during reading

### ✅ PDF Notification Issue in Release Mode - FIXED
**Status**: COMPLETED ✅
**Problem**: PDF notifications only work in debug mode, not release mode. Download notifications work in both.
**Root Cause**: PDF notifications are called after background processing where the NotificationService may not be properly initialized in release mode, unlike download notifications which are called from warm UI context.
**Solution Applied**: 
- Added `_ensureNotificationServiceReady()` method to PdfConversionService
- Re-initialize NotificationService before each PDF notification call
- This ensures proper service initialization for release mode compatibility
**Commit**: `880cdba` - fix: re-initialize NotificationService before PDF notifications

### ✅ Tag Navigation Fix - COMPLETED
**Status**: COMPLETED ✅  
**Problem**: Clicking tags in detail_screen doesn't navigate properly to home with search
**Solution Applied**: 
- Fixed navigation to use AppRouter.goToHome with search parameter
- Added navigation lock to prevent multiple rapid taps
- Enhanced logging for debugging
**Commit**: `db4e47f` - fix: tag navigation from detail_screen to home with search

### ✅ Android Notification Permissions - COMPLETED  
**Status**: COMPLETED ✅
**Problem**: Missing notification permissions for Android 13+
**Solution Applied**:
- Added POST_NOTIFICATIONS permission to AndroidManifest.xml
- Added VIBRATE permission for enhanced notifications
- Enhanced NotificationService for Android 13+ permission handling
**Commit**: `b1fc6b5` - feat: add Android 13+ notification permissions and enhance service

## 🚨 **URGENT BUG: PDF Notifications Missing in Release Mode**

### **Issue Description:**
- **Problem**: PDF conversion notifications appear in debug mode but not in release mode
- **Root Cause**: Android permission handling differs between debug and release builds
- **Impact**: Users don't get feedback on PDF conversion progress in production

### **Solution Required:**
```xml
<!-- Add to android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.VIBRATE" />
```

### **Additional Fix:**
```dart
// In NotificationService.requestNotificationPermission()
// Add fallback for release builds
if (Platform.isAndroid) {
  final androidInfo = await DeviceInfoPlugin().androidInfo;
  if (androidInfo.version.sdkInt >= 33) {
    // Android 13+ requires explicit notification permission
    final status = await Permission.notification.request();
    return status.isGranted;
  } else {
    // Older Android versions, notifications are enabled by default
    return true;
  }
}
```

### **Testing Steps:**
1. Build release APK with updated permissions
2. Test PDF conversion with notifications enabled
3. Verify notifications appear on different Android versions
4. Test permission request flow in release mode

### **Estimated Effort:** 0.5 day
